# Data Science Portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for self learning and personal interests. Presented in the form of Jupyter notebooks, R markdown files, and Alteryx files.

#### My Kaggle portfolio is located [here](https://www.kaggle.com/carlkcheng).

## Contents

- ### Machine Learning

	- [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://github.com/carlMAXs/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Fraud%20Detection%20with%20Supervised%20Learning.ipynb): A model that classifies credit card transactions to identify fraudulant behaivours. Contents include EDA, piplelines for data processing on an imbalanced data, modeling with supervised learning, hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV, and ROC-AUC.

	Tools: Python, scikit-learn, Imb-learn, Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib.
	
- ### Database and SQL Qurey
	- [Detection of Suspicious Payment Transactions](https://github.com/carlMAXs/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Detection_of_suspicious_payment_transactions): A micro project focused on creating a database on MySQL local server and managing database on MySQL workbench, incorporating window function and aggregate functions into our queries to check for shady transactions. In order to enrich the table based on the current schema, I also created some synthetic data produced by Python scripts.
	
	Tools: SQL(Window function, Aggretate function, MySQL workbench), Python
	
- ### Data Analytics and Visualisation

	- [BIXI Bike Sharing Revenue Estimation](https://github.com/carlMAXs/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/BIXI%20Data%20analysis.yxmd): A workflow in Alteryx and Excel to analyse anaual revenue generated on bike leasing by BIXI.

	Tools: Alteryx, Tableau, Microsoft Excel.
